## Introduction
This repository showcases a variety of Python programming challenges, ranging from data structure manipulation to practical applications. Each script demonstrates different aspects of Python programming, helping to reinforce fundamental concepts and problem-solving skills.

## Projects

### Add Two Numbers
#### File: addtwonumbers.py
This script implements a solution to add two numbers represented as linked lists. It demonstrates:

- Linked list manipulation
- Reverse traversal
- Arithmetic operations on complex data structures

Learning to work with linked lists and perform operations on them is crucial for understanding data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental to computer science and software development.

### Alternating Case
#### File: alternative.py
This script provides two methods to alternate the case of characters in a string:

1. Alternating case for each character
2. Alternating case for each word

It showcases:

- String manipulation
- Use of loops and conditionals
- Working with indexes

String manipulation is a common task in programming, and this script helps practice essential string operations in Python.

### Cafe Inventory
#### File: cafe.py
This script calculates the total stock value of a cafe's inventory. It demonstrates:

- Working with lists and dictionaries
- Iterating through data structures
- Performing calculations based on multiple data sources

Understanding how to work with different data structures and perform operations on them is crucial for managing and analyzing data in real-world applications.

### Holiday Cost Calculator
#### File: holiday.py
This interactive script calculates the total cost of a holiday based on user input. It showcases:

- User input handling
- Function definitions and calls
- Conditional statements
- Basic arithmetic operations

This project demonstrates how to create a practical application that integrates various programming concepts to solve a real-world problem.

## Installation
To run these scripts, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.
After installing Python, clone this repository to your local machine:
> git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-programming-challenges.git

> cd python-programming-challenges

## Usage
To run any of the scripts, use the Python interpreter followed by the script name. For example:
> python addtwonumbers.py

> python alternative.py

> python cafe.py

> python holiday.py
